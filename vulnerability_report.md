# Vulnerability Report: Flask CI/CD Pipeline

## Introduction

During the CI/CD pipeline execution for the secure Flask web application, a vulnerability scanning stage was integrated using Trivy. The scan was performed on the Docker image built from the Flask application source code. This process aimed to identify known vulnerabilities early in the development pipeline to improve the overall security posture of the deployed application.

## Vulnerability Findings

The Trivy scan revealed the following vulnerabilities:

1. **perl-base (CVE-2023-31484)** - Severity: High  
Status: Affected  
Summary: TLS certificates were not properly verified when downloading distributions over HTTPS, leading to potential man-in-the-middle (MitM) risks.

2. **perl-base (CVE-2024-56406)** - Severity: High  
Status: Fixed  
Summary: Heap overflow vulnerability in Perl's memory management, which could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

3. **zlib1g (CVE-2023-45853)** - Severity: Critical  
Status: Will not fix  
Summary: Integer overflow and resultant heap-based buffer overflow in zlib when processing zip files, allowing for possible exploitation.

4. **setuptools (Python Package) (CVE-2024-6345)** - Severity: High  
Status: Fixed  
Summary: Remote code execution vulnerability in setuptools during package installation due to insufficient input validation.

## Mitigation Steps

- For CVE-2024-56406, the vulnerability was addressed by updating the perl-base package to a fixed version (5.36.0-7+deb12u2).
- For CVE-2023-31484, mitigation includes enforcing strict internal TLS validation policies when pulling external dependencies, as an upstream fix is pending.
- For CVE-2023-45853, continuous monitoring is advised, and critical zlib usage is minimized to reduce risk until an upstream fix becomes available.
- For CVE-2024-6345, the setuptools package was updated to version 70.0.0, eliminating the identified vulnerability.

Additionally, dependency management will continue to focus on using trusted package sources and minimizing the container base image footprint to reduce the attack surface.

## Conclusion

The CI/CD pipeline successfully integrated security best practices by incorporating static code analysis and Docker image vulnerability scanning. Trivy effectively identified critical and high-severity vulnerabilities before deployment. By addressing vulnerabilities early, the project demonstrated a strong DevSecOps approach, significantly reducing production risk. Ongoing scanning, patching, and secure development practices will remain a priority moving forward.
